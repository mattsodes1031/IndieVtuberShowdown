# IVS SOURCE CODE
Hello it's your boy GWebDev again! \
This is the source code of the Indie VTuber Showdown Mod! \
Hope you like it :) \
I coded this whole shit in 6 days for the demo lol (idk if i'm wrong or not) \
Expect glitches or some shit cause i rushed this \
Oh and i tried to do lib bullcrap to prevent android porters because :/ YO i'm going to make an android version of IVS \
Oh and if you DO think about making a cringy port like Beach Brother or Tabi then \
I will go into every video you make and comment on it lol \
I'm also planning to make IVS available on IOS and LINUX so yeee \
Till then you could also go to the itch.io page of the game lol \
